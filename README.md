# OS contracts lib

This repo will hold a collection of open source Solidity contracts for the
Ethereum platform. 

# BIG DISCLAIMER

I'm doing it to learn the Solidity ecosystem so the big **DISCLAIMER** applies of
not basing your ICO or investment fund on this code; if you do don't blame me if a
bug leaves you homeless and forcing you to sell your body to the best bidder
(*which could also be done using a blockchain contract by the way*).
